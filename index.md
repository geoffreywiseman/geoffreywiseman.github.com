A guide to some of the projects I host here on github.

## Public Projects

These are projects that I've been actively working on, sharing with others in some form:

- [Moo](http://geoffreywiseman.github.com/Moo), a Java library for mapping objects to objects, doing graph translations and graph updates.
- [Prune](http://geoffreywiseman.github.com/prune/), a configurable Ruby application/framework for analyzing and pruning files from a folder to do things like make backups increasingly sparse.
- [Tunnel Boring Machine](http://geoffreywiseman.github.com/tunnel-boring-machine/) (TBM), a ruby command-line application for managing and opening SSH tunnels, a sort of simple VPN.
- [genhost](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/genhost), an application for generating host files, typically to allow you to switch settings from one location to another.
- [Maven Growl](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/maven-growl), a thin wrapper script to pump Maven output into Growl on OS X.
- [Maven Notification Center](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/maven-notification-center), a thin wrapper script to pump Maven output in to OS X Notification Center.

## Incubating Projects

These are projects that are in some nascent state where you might want to look at them, but I'm hesitant to describe as public:

- [CDNPay Parser](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/cdnpay-parser), a parser for the PDFs generated by the Canadian Payments Association.
